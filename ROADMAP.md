History and roadmap of the WebAssembly music project
====================================================

# 1988 - 1993

- The Commodore Amiga demo scene times
  - Tracking music in Soundtracker, Noisetracker and Protracker
  - Music and m68k assembly coding in the group Pure Metal Coders

# 1994 - 2005

- Playing with hardware synths
- DAWs
- Soft synths
- Linux music software

# 2005 - 2018

- Created the Open Source DAW [Frinika](https://frinika.com) in Java
- Evolved to a nice little open source community with many significant contributions

# 2018

- Writing music sequences in Javascript (nodejs)
  - Using nodejs midi for connecting to synths
  - https://youtu.be/oPfOeEbM4M0
- Programming music with 4klang in x86 assembly
  - https://youtu.be/Tc-qRUStxBQ
  - https://youtu.be/ujzPS5cXUrE
- Use Javascript to generate sequences for 4klang and generate native executable file

# 2019

- WebAssembly Music Experiment
  - Tiny Wasm file generating music https://youtu.be/U-HTcaLoiLg
  - Live music programming in AssemblyScript [WebAssembly studio](https://webassembly.studio/) https://youtu.be/ThkIgYcvkMU
  - Simple Web UI for the webassembly synth connected to MIDI keyboards https://youtu.be/iYURirijDkQ
  - Virtual keyboard: https://youtu.be/6dem1GHOmos
  - Live coding editor for sequence (Javascript)
    - https://youtu.be/ZQUo2fZwUgw

# 2020

- Demo at the WebAssembly Summit: https://youtu.be/C8j_ieOm4vE
- Integrate Yoshimi ported to Wasm with Emscripten: https://youtu.be/HH92wXnP4WU
- Git client and offline storage (Wasm-git): https://youtu.be/65owWFCYiL0
- NEAR-protocol for access control and payments for server-side git repos https://youtu.be/KsMbWTq7Z7Q
- Physical modeling synthesis: https://youtu.be/FHST7rLxhLM

# 2021

- More physical modeling synthesis ( https://youtu.be/QW97w8Ub5fU )
- WebAssembly music stored on the NEAR protocol blockchain as Non-Fungible Token (NFT)
- https://youtu.be/hAvIm0F3scg
- NFT frontend with music player, music customizer (rearranging, looping and combining different parts), mixer, instrument player
- User invitations/onboarding without a NEAR account (using NEAR implicit accounts)
- Audio player through the AssemblyScript synth

# 2022

- Simple, efficient and easy to use sequencer and midi-recording UI
- Graphical effects triggered by the music ( shader support )
- Video player through shader

# Future ( 2021 - 2022 )

- Make more and better music
- More Wasm-git UIs
- Web UI for playing WebAssembly music modules
- Simplify synth programming with AssemblyScript
- Improve clip detection and basic mastering tools
- Physical modeling synth UI
- Interactive apps with easy and entertaining UI for evolving and republishing music NFTs
- NFT contracts with auction, commission
- Support for audio files in IPFS for also being able to host regular audio file NFTs
- Fungible Tokens for shares when co-operating on an NFT music project, as well raising funds
